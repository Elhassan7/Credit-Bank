# Loan bank 
The goal of this project of machine learning to predict if someone can get the loan from bank . and deploy a model of it on production using Flask API.
## Prerequisites
Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed
## Project Structure
1- credit_bank.ipynb - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict if someone can get the loan from bank on trainign data in 'train_data.csv' file.
2- app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives applicant  details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3- templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow administrator of bank to enter loan detail and displays the predicted if he can accept give loan or reject it .
